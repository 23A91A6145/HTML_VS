<!-- Elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
They can be nested within block elements and do not disrupt the flow of text.
Inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>>`, `<img>`, and others. 
They are typically used for styling or linking text without breaking the flow . -->
