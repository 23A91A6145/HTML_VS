    <p>The error in your query is that you're updating the email addresses and then trying to select the same email addresses that contain the old domain (@oldmail.com). However, since you've already updated those email addresses to the new domain (@newmail.com), the select statement won't return any rows that contain the old domain.
    </p>
    <p>To fix this, you should select all customers along with their updated email addresses. Here's the corrected query:
    </p>
    <p>UPDATE Customer 
        SET EMAIL = CUSTOMERNAME || '@newmail.com' 
        WHERE EMAIL LIKE '%oldmail.com';
        
        SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, EMAIL 
        FROM Customer;
        </p>
